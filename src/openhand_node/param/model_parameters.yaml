#OPTIONS:

#IDS: Place the servo ids you intend to use in the list. Please note
#that the order you choose is important to which motor is added for
#each finger.

#Servo Type: This package supports 'RX','MX', and "XM" Dynamixel motors.
#If you have any protocol 2 X-Series, input 'XM' as the motor type.

#Servo port can be found using the commands noted on the Yale Openhand Workshop page.

#The type must be exact to what is specified in code. I recommend using the
#predefined blocks as specified.

#The direction of the motors is unique to each openhand. Please follow the blocks below.
#You should not have to change this value in the block, this is taken into accound in the hands.py file

#The motor_offset is used to calibrate motors so that slack in the tendons is mitigated
#These are sensitive to the servo_ids order you specified earlier
